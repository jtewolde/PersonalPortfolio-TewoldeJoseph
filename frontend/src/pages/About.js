                    Hello there! My name is Joseph Tewolde! It's a pleasure to meet you!
                    Please take a moment to look around my website and get to know me a little better through my projects and experiences!

                </p>

                <p className="about-paragraph">

                    I am a recent May 2025 computer science graduate from Metropolitian State University of Denver!  
                    I am passionate about software development and I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow!
                    Some of my hobbies include playing video games, watching sports like NBA basketball and NFL football, and spending time with my family and friends! <br></br> <br></br>


                    Throughout my academic career, I have worked on various projects that have helped me develop my skills as a software developer.
                    Using tools like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, I have been able to create full-stack applications that are both functional and visually appealing.
                    I am excited to continue learning and growing as a software developer and I am looking forward to the opportunities that lie ahead!
